SELECT AVG(energy) AS avg_energy, AVG(valence) AS avg_valence, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability FROM songs;


possible issues:
- extreme moods get smoothed out by avg
- time spent listening to certain songs is not factored
- if more than 100 songs are listened to frequently, these are not factored in
- overall music preferences is likely not factored well in activity-based playlists (workout, study, ...)

possible improvements:
- add time spent listening for songs to include significance of each song (maybe also frequency & recency?)
- do not calculate with 100 songs automatically, rather calculate with e.g. top 30% songs the user spent 70% time listening tosqlite3
